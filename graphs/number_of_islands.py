Problem: Number of Islands
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/

Clarification Questions:
1. Can the grid be empty? -> Yes, return 0
2. Are inputs always '0' and '1' (string)? -> Yes
3. What defines an island? -> 1's connected vertically or horizontally (not diagonally)
4. Modifying grid in place allowed? -> Yes, safe for interview

Approach:
1. Iterate through each cell in the grid
2. If a cell is '1', it's a new island â†’ start DFS/BFS from there
3. DFS/BFS marks all connected '1's as '0' (visited)
4. Repeat until entire grid is scanned
5. Return the count of islands

DFS/BFS:
Time Complexity: O(m * n)
Space Complexity: O(m * n) in worst case recursion stack
