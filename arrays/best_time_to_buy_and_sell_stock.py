Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

Clarification Questions:
1. Can prices be empty? -> Yes, return 0
2. Can prices have negative values? -> No, stock prices are non-negative
3. What if no profit is possible? -> Return 0
4. Is only one transaction allowed? -> Yes, buy once and sell once

Approaches:
1. Brute Force (O(n^2) time, O(1) space)
2. Optimized (Track min price + max profit in one pass) â€“ O(n) time, O(1) space
